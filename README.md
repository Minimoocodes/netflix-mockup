Hi!

Welcome to my netflix-mockup.

This project was to practice React.

Here I learnt routing, useQuery, api fetching with Axios, and on top of that, file structure for a big projects.
I have devided the projects to common components, constants, layout, hooks, pages, and utils to be visually structured. 

For components, I got more used to npm packages and bootstrap.

Thank you for your time!
